Polymorphism among amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates are emerging as the main contributors to the observed phenotypic diversity in sporadic Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease (sAD). Aggregation of Aβ is susceptible to several heterotypic factors, and lipids (LDs) are the most important physiological agents to interact with and modulate Aβ aggregation. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of how LDs modulate Aβ aggregation to generate polymorphic strains along competing pathways is crucial for understanding AD pathogenesis as small-sized oligomer believed to be a key cause of neural loss in AD patients. We have used the game theory model to abstract the mass-action based non-linear, coupled dynamical system of competing pathways of aggregation. Through analysis, we found higher LD concentration leads to the generation of more micelle-bound oligomers (promoting the off-pathway of aggregation), higher levels of dilution of the medium result in dissociating micelle bound oligomers enabling higher conversion to fibrils (promoting the traditional on-pathway of aggregation). These models were subsequently validated by our previously developed ensemble kinetics simulations (EKS) that use ordinary differential equations based models of the competing pathways to estimate the rate constants of converting oligomers between on- and off-pathway aggregates\n","date":1600220667,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600220667,"objectID":"f6c13ea1def040a505c469b99675e336","permalink":"/project/protein-aggregation-dynamics-in-alzheimers-disease/","publishdate":"2020-09-15T21:44:27-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/protein-aggregation-dynamics-in-alzheimers-disease/","section":"project","summary":"Correspondence between experimental results and EKS models on switching of pathway","tags":[],"title":"Protein Aggregation Dynamics in Alzheimer's Disease","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"\u0026ldquo;Synthetic biologists endeavor to predict the increasing complexity of multistep signaling cascades impacts the fidelity of molecular signaling, whereby information about the cellular state is often transmitted with proteins that diffuse by a pseudo-one-dimensional stochastic process.

Aβ aggregates, especially the low-molecular weight oligomers, are the primary toxic agents in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, there is increasing interest in understanding their formation and behaviour. In this paper, we use our previously established results on heterotypic interactions between Aβ and fatty acids (FAs) to investigate off-pathway aggregation under the control of FA concentrations to develop a mathematical framework that captures the mechanism. Our framework to define and simulate the competing on- and off-pathways of Aβ aggregation is based on the principles of game theory. Together with detailed simulations and biophysical experiments, our models describe the dynamics involved in the mechanisms of Aβ aggregation in the presence of FAs to adopt multiple pathways. Specifically, our reduced-order computations indicate that the emergence of off- or on-pathway aggregates are tightly controlled by a narrow set of rate constants, and one could alter such parameters to populate a particular oligomeric species. These models agree with the detailed simulations and experimental data on using FA as a heterotypic partner to modulate the temporal parameters. Predicting spatio-temporal landscape along competing pathways for a given heterotypic partner such as lipids is a first step towards simulating scenarios in which the generation of specific ‘conformer strains’ of Aβ could be predicted. This approach could be significant in deciphering the mechanisms of amyloid aggregation and strain generation, which are ubiquitously observed in many neurodegenerative diseases.","tags":[],"title":"A game theoretic approach to deciphering the dynamics of amyloid- Ab aggregation along competing pathways","type":"publication"},{"authors":["pratip rana","edian f. franco","yug rao","khajamoinuddin syed","debmalya barh","vasco azevedo","rommel t. j. ramos","preetam ghosh"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600028749,"objectID":"a55610534480a03afba99c63b807dc37","permalink":"/publication/rana-2019-evaluation/","publishdate":"2020-09-13T20:25:49.059904Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rana-2019-evaluation/","section":"publication","summary":"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative disorders related to aging.

In order to get better insights, we predicted the gene co-expression network for both AD and PD using network analysis algorithms applied to two GEO datasets. The network analysis revealed six clusters of genes related to AD and four clusters of genes related to PD; however, there was very low functional similarity between these clusters, pointing to insignificant similarity between AD and PD even at the level of affected biological processes.

In Alzheimer disease (AD), intrinsically disordered amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides undergo aggregation that is sensitive to environmental conditions. High-molecular weight aggregates of Aβ that form insoluble fibrils are deposited as senile plaques in AD brains. However, low-molecular weight aggregates called soluble oligomers are known to be the primary toxic agents responsible for neuronal dysfunction. The aggregation process is highly stochastic involving both homotypic (Aβ-Aβ) and heterotypic (Aβ with interacting partners) interactions. Two of the important members of interacting partners are membrane lipids and surfactants, to which Aβ shows a perpetual association. Aβ–membrane interactions have been widely investigated for more than two decades, and this research has provided a wealth of information. Although this has greatly enriched our understanding, the objective of this review is to consolidate the information from the literature that collectively showcases the unique phenomenon of lipid-mediated Aβ oligomer generation, which has largely remained inconspicuous. This is especially important because Aβ aggregate “strains” are increasingly becoming relevant in light of the correlations between the structure of aggregates and AD phenotypes. Here, we will focus on aspects of Aβ-lipid interactions specifically from the context of how lipid modulation generates a wide variety of biophysically and biochemically distinct oligomer sub-types. This, we believe, will refocus our thinking on the influence of lipids and open new approaches in delineating the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis.

Emerging evidence indicates that polymorphic variations in Aβ fibrils contribute to phenotypic diversity and the rate of disease progression in AD.

Here, we have dissected and evaluated individually the kinetics of macroscopic phases in aggregation to gain insight into the process of strain propagation. The bulk rates determined experimentally in each phase were used to build an ensemble kinetic simulation model, which confirmed our observation that dodecamer seeds initially grow by monomer addition toward the formation of a key intermediate.

Currently, no systematic effort has been made to treat an isolated feed-forward loop as a stand-Alone signal amplifying/attenuating device and understand its communication capacity in terms of the diffusion of individual molecules. To address this issue, in this paper we derive a theorem that estimates the upper and lower bounds of the channel capacity for a relay channel, which structurally corresponds to a feed-forward loop, by using an additive inverse Gaussian noise channel model of protein-ligand binding. Our results are just a first step towards assessing the performance bounds of simplified biological circuits in order to guide the development and optimization of synthetic, bio-inspired devices that can be used as information processing and forwarding units.","tags":["\"additive inverse gaussian channel\"","\"broadcast and relay channels\"","\"channel capacity\"","\"molecular communication\"","\"multiple access\""],"title":"Capacity estimates of additive inverse Gaussian molecular channels with relay characteristics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["s. sen","n. chakraborty","p. rana","r. sahu","s. singh","a. k. panda","s. tripathy","d. k. pradhan","a. sen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600028750,"objectID":"63b4c101e46f73209fe56c7af6a201bb","permalink":"/publication/sen-2016-effect/","publishdate":"2020-09-13T20:25:50.730268Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sen-2016-effect/","section":"publication","summary":"Polycrystalline  GaFe1-xTixO3(x=0, 0.05,0.10, 0.15) samples were synthesized by solid state reaction.The effect of substitution of Ti at the Fe site on the structuralparameters, dielectric and magnetic was studied.

This has direct implications in the regulation of various signaling pathways and types of cancers. We use information diffusion theory to quantify inuence diffusion in a miRNA-miRNA regulation network across 'Carcinoma' diseases and determine critical miRNAs which play an influential role. We demonstrate that using this model, we can find important disease-specific miRNAs which tend to work closely.
