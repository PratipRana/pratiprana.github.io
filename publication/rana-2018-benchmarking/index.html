  <meta name="description" content="Synthetic biologists endeavor to predict how the increasing complexity of multi-step signaling cascades impacts the fidelity of molecular signaling, whereby information about the cellular state is often transmitted with proteins that diffuse by a pseudo-one-dimensional stochastic process. This begs the question of how the cell leverages passive transport mechanisms to distinguish informative signals from the intrinsic noise of diffusion. We address this problem by using a one-dimensional drift-diffusion model to derive an approximate lower bound on the degree of facilitation needed to achieve single-bit informational efficiency in signaling cascades as a function of their length. Within the assumptions of our model, we find that a universal curve of the Shannon-Hartley form describes the information transmitted by a signaling chain of arbitrary length and depends upon only a small number of physically measur-able parameters.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">Synthetic biologists endeavor to predict how the increasing complexity of multi-step signaling cascades impacts the fidelity of molecular signaling, whereby information about the cellular state is often transmitted with proteins that diffuse by a pseudo-one-dimensional stochastic process. This begs the question of how the cell leverages passive transport mechanisms to distinguish informative signals from the intrinsic noise of diffusion. We address this problem by using a one-dimensional drift-diffusion model to derive an approximate lower bound on the degree of facilitation needed to achieve single-bit informational efficiency in signaling cascades as a function of their length. Within the assumptions of our model, we find that a universal curve of the Shannon-Hartley form describes the information transmitted by a signaling chain of arbitrary length and depends upon only a small number of physically measur-able parameters. This enables our model to be used in conjunction with experimental measurements to aid in the selective design of biomolecular systems that can over-come noise to function reliably, even at the single-cell level. © 2018 Author(s).

From CRISPR/Cas9 gene drives that alter our genetic code 1 to proteins designed to modulate the sensitivity of molecular signaling cascades, 2,3 the state of the art has learned to imitate nature and, in so doing, surpass it. The cost of interfacing with biology at its most granular level, however, is that we must leverage fragile biomolecular components that transmit information far below the modern standards of electronic communications. For example, the transcriptional signaling pathways in a cell cannot reliably cross the minimal single-bit threshold required to distinguish meaningful signals from noise, 4 and coherent communication is only achieved when signaling is averaged over an entire cellular population. 4–6 Although some biological signaling does utilize electric currents, such as that in the human nervous system, 7 information transmitted at the cellular level is often accomplished via so-called molecular communication, in which discrete signaling molecules diffuse through an intervening liquid medium from a transmitting to a receiving site. 8,9 Because Brownian motion alone is slow and unreliable, many biological systems attempt to facilitate this diffusion with a variety of mechanisms, such as motor proteins that &quot; walk &quot; the molecules along cytoskeletal filaments, 10 transcription factors that locate their receiving site by sliding back and forth along the DNA contour, 11 and bacterial chemotaxis, in which molecules are carried by bacteria along a chemical gradient. 12 These types of directed-diffusion processes typically exhibit a superdiffusive mean squared displacement that scales as t α , for 1 &lt; α &lt; 2, 13 and are often well approximated as one-dimensional stochastic processes a Electronic mail: <a href="mailto:Kevin.R.Pilkiewicz@usace.army.mil">Kevin.R.Pilkiewicz@usace.army.mil</a></p>
