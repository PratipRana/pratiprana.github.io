 abstract = {Polycrystalline  GaFe1-xTixO3(x=0, 0.05,0.10, 0.15) samples were synthesized by solid state reaction.The effect of substitution of Ti at the Fe site on the structuralparameters, dielectric and magnetic was studied. Themonophasic compounds crystallized in the orthorhombicspace group pc21n and the unit cell volume decreases withincreasing Ti content. The dielectric constant has increasedwhile the dielectric loss has decreased at higher temperatureas compared to parent compound GaFeO3after doping Tiions at the Fe site. Doping of Ti has also decreased theferrimagnetism.},
