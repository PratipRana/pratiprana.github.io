 abstract = {Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). miRNAs (non-coding RNAs of âˆ¼20-22 nt size) exhibit a self-regulatory mechanism through which they act as positive/negative regulators of expression of genes and other miRNAs. This has direct implications in the regulation of various signaling pathways and types of cancers. We use information diffusion theory to quantify inuence diffusion in a miRNA-miRNA regulation network across 'Carcinoma' diseases and determine critical miRNAs which play an influential role. We demonstrate that using this model, we can find important disease-specific miRNAs which tend to work closely. These results prove to be significant based on validation with previously established methods. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},
