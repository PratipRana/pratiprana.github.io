 abstract = {Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO<inf>3</inf>) without any co-formed impurity phase was synthesized by sonochemical method. The average crystallite sizes of synthesized BiFeO<inf>3</inf> for two sonication times of 40 min and 2 h were found to be 38 and 32 nm and the corresponding band gaps were 2.1 and 2.2 eV, respectively. In contrast to BiFeO<inf>3</inf> synthesized by conventional precipitation route which gives rise to co-formed impurity phases, the sonochemically prepared phase-pure BiFeO<inf>3</inf> nanoparticles exhibited an excellent low-ppm SO<inf>2</inf> sensing behaviour with fast response and recovery. Also the sonochemically synthesized BiFeO<inf>3</inf> was selective to SO<inf>2</inf> in presence of carbon monoxide and butane and may turn out to be a potential functional material for SO<inf>2</inf> leak alarms.},
